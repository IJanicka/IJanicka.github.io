    <p><br>I am a researcher in contemporary European philosophy, working on questions of politics and ecology. I focus on social transformation, specifically in light of current climate change. My first monograph, *Theorizing Contemporary Anarchism* (Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), considers the concept of universality and social change in contemporary philosophy. My second monograph (in progress) deals with the question of how to think politics and nonhumans together. I am currently affiliated with the department of Aesthetics and Culture at Aarhus University, Denmark. </p>
