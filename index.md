    <p>I am a researcher in contemporary European philosophy, working on the question of social transformation.</p>
    <p>Currently I focus on the nexus of politics and ecology, specifically on social transformation in light of climate change. My ongoing book project deals with the question of how to think politics and nonhumans together. My first book, <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/theorizing-contemporary-anarchism-9781474276191/" target="_blank"><i>Theorizing Contemporary Anarchism. Solidarity, Mimesis and Radical Social Change</i></a> (Bloomsbury, 2017), considered the concept of universality and social change in contemporary philosophy.</p> 
    <p>I am Research Team Leader at the Center for Environmental and Technology Ethics - Prague <a href="https://cetep.eu" target="_blank">(CETE-P)</a> and Senior Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>
