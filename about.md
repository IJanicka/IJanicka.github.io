**Research profile**<br>
At the heart of my research lies the question of social transformation: How can we conceptualize and engage in politics that is relevant for the 21st century? Specifically, I focus on how politics is transformed in light of current climate change and rapid technological developments. In my work, I attempt to articulate a ‘nonhuman politics’, that is, politics for more-than-human worlds, in which questions of collective solidarity and alternative socio-political practices play an important part. By engaging with thinkers within broadly considered posthumanities and environmental philosophy, I hope to capture a series of transformations that are taking place in philosophy, art practices and in our cognitive maps of the world.<br>
