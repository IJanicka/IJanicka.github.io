    <p><br>I am a Researcher at Aarhus Univerity. Iwona's research interests lie within the area of twentieth- and twenty-first-century French and German philosophy, political thought and Theory (French, Critical, Literary, Feminist, Queer, Anarchist). Her first monograph, Theorizing Contemporary Anarchism. Solidarity, Mimesis and Radical Social Change (Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), considers the concept of universality and social transformation in contemporary philosophy. Her second monograph (in progress) deals with the question of how to think politics and nonhumans together. </p>
