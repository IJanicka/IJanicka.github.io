    <p>I am Research Team Leader at the Center for Environmental and Technology Ethics - Prague <a href="https://cetep.eu" target="_blank">(CETE-P)</a> and Senior Researcher at the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences.</p>
    <p> I work in contemporary European philosophy. I focus on the nexus of politics and ecology, specifically on the question of social transformation in light of climate change. My ongoing book project examines how to think politics and nonhumans together. </p>
