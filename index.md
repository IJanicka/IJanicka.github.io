    <p>I am a researcher in contemporary European philosophy, working on the question of social transformation.</p>
    <p> My first monograph, <i>Theorizing Contemporary Anarchism</i> (Bloomsbury Academic, 2017), considers the concept of universality and social change in contemporary philosophy. More recently, I have turned to questions of politics and ecology and I focus on social transformation in light of climate change. My second monograph (in progress) deals with the question of how to think politics and nonhumans together.</p> 
    <p>I am currently affiliated with the department of Aesthetics and Culture at Aarhus University, Denmark.</p>
